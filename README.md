# üîç Algorithm Practice Repository

Welcome! This repository is a personal learning space where I, a student passionate about programming, explore and implement basic algorithms in Python.

All files are located in the `Algorithm` folder.

## üìã What‚Äôs included?

### Sorting Algorithms

- **student_search_and_sort.py**  
  Mini-project with selection sort, linear search, binary search, user input, and interactive menu.
- **selection_sort.py**  
  Standalone selection sort example.
- **linear_search.py**  
  Linear search with complexity analysis.
- **binary_search.py**  
  Binary search for sorted lists.
- **bubble_sort.py**  
  Bubble sort implementation.
- **merge_sort.py**  
  Merge sort with user input.
- **quick_sort.py**  
  Quick sort with user input.
- **heap_sort.py**  
  Heap sort with user input.
- **compare_sorts_by_time.py**  
  Compare bubble, selection, insertion, merge, quick, and heap sort on the same input and show timing.

### Binary Tree Algorithms

- **binary_tree_user_input.py**  
  Build a binary tree from user input and print its structure.
- **binary_tree_inOrder.py**  
  Inorder traversal of a binary tree.
- **binary_tree_preOrder.py**  
  Preorder traversal of a binary tree.
- **binary_tree_postOrder.py**  
  Postorder traversal of a binary tree.
- **binary_tree_levelOrder(BFS).py**  
  Level order (BFS) traversal of a binary tree.
- **binary_tree_allTraversal.py**  
  All traversals (preorder, inorder, postorder, level order) and tree visualization.
