# 🔍 Algorithm Practice Repository

Welcome! This repository is a personal learning space where I, a student passionate about programming, explore and implement basic algorithms in Python.


##  What’s included?

### ✅ `student_search_and_sort.py`
A complete mini-project combining:
- ✅ **Selection Sort** (to sort student marks)
- ✅ **Linear Search** (to find marks in unsorted list)
- ✅ **Binary Search** (to find marks in sorted list)
- ✅ With user input and interactive menu

### ✅ `selection_sort.py`
Standalone example of selection sort with comments and clarity.

### ✅ `linear_search.py`
Simple implementation of linear search with complexity analysis.

### ✅ `binary_search.py`
Basic binary search example assuming sorted input.
